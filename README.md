# Simple Office Networking Project

I wanted to be able to demonstrate my network skills. I have started with a simple Office project so that I can show my networking fundamentals. In the next project I will be doing a more challenging project to demonstrate intermediate skills. 

# Case Study and Requirements:

Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
- Each department should contain at least two PCs.
- An appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
- Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
- All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
- Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

# Skills Implemented:
- Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
- Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
- Connecting two Networks using a Router.
- Subnetting and IP Addressing.
- Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
- Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
- Test and Verifying Network Communication.
